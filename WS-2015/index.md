# Wster WS-2015

Main MCU: AC4601<br>
[Download Original Firmware](WS2015Flash.bin)<br>
[Contents of Firmware](WS2015Flash.bin_Contents/)

This is the hard-bricked one, I have one more identical device which is fine.<br>
Since I've successfully unpacked its firmware, I will replace the MCU and try to flash a modified firmware.<br>
